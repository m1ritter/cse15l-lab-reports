INSTALLING VS CODE: 
Much like many of my fellow classmates, I already had VS Code downloaded to my mac. I opted to work on my computer rather than the lab computers since 
I am more familiar with the mac interface and my personal set up. I was able to get VS Code open rather quickly and clipped a quick screenshot! Here is 
the main window you should see when opening the code-editing application.

REMOTELY CONNECTING: 
Now here is the tricky bit. First you have to follow the link provided in the lab directions, and find yourself at a UCSD page that asks for your username (the first half of your email before @ucsd.edu) and your PID. From here, it gives you a special username beginning in "cs15lwi23." You then have to create a new password that will serve as your access to the remote computer. It takes approximately 15 minutes before the password is officially changed and can be used. Once this happens, you create a new terminal in VS code (top menu bar on desktop -> Terminal -> New Terminal). In the terminal we use the "ssh" key word (which stands for Secure Shell) to access the remote computer. I typed $ ssh (insert username)@ieng6.ucsd.edu, which then prompted me to type my new password. Note: for security purposes, when you type your password the keys do not show up.
